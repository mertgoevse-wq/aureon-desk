## Safe Self-Audit & Optimization System — 2026-07-09

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Critical issue review | ✅ PASS — no open Critical Issues in `docs/ISSUES_REGISTER.md` |
| `npm run verify:native` (pre-change) | ✅ PASS |
| `npm run typecheck` (pre-change) | ✅ PASS |
| `npm test` (pre-change, 561 unit tests) | ✅ PASS |
| `npm run build` (pre-change) | ✅ PASS |
| `npm run typecheck` (post-change) | ✅ PASS |
| `npm test` (post-change, 597 unit tests) | ✅ PASS |
| `npm run build` (post-change) | ✅ PASS |
| Code review | ✅ PASS — issues found and fixed (PROJECT_ROOT path, local_only guards, any types) |

### Changes

| Area | Change |
|------|--------|
| Shared types | Created `src/shared/self-audit.ts` with 12 categories, 4 severities, 4 modes, redacted/safe patterns |
| Audit engine | Created `src/main/services/self-audit.service.ts` — read-only, local-only, mode-gated file reading |
| IPC | Created `src/main/ipc/self-audit.ipc.ts` — typed handlers for audit/plan/patch |
| UI page | Created `src/renderer/src/pages/SelfAudit.tsx` — full audit UI with 3-tab layout |
| Routing | Added `/self-audit` and `/settings/self-audit` routes, settings nav item |
| Preload | Exposed 4 self-audit IPC methods to renderer |
| Tests | Added `tests/unit/self-audit.test.ts` — 36 tests (597 total) |
| Safety | No autonomous self-modification, mode-gated reads, always redacts secrets, approval gate |

### Bugs Fixed During Review

| Bug | Severity | Fix |
|-----|----------|-----|
| PROJECT_ROOT resolved to wrong dir (3 levels up instead of 2) | Critical | Fixed with fallback verification against package.json |
| `local_only` mode read source file contents | Major | Added early return guards in checkCriticalIssues and checkDeadCode |
| `any` types in IPC handlers | Major | Replaced with AuditReport and ImprovementPlan types |
| Placeholder categories counted as 'pass' instead of 'skipped' | Minor | Changed checkPlaceholderCategory status to 'skipped' |

### Remaining Limits

- 7 of 12 categories are structural placeholders (require running app for deep analysis)
- Visual QA (manual `npm run dev` click-through) deferred
- SessionStorage key for Open in Code Mode not yet consumed by LivePreview
- `AI_QA_REPORT.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` contents not deeply analyzed (only existence checked)

## Safe Connector & MCP Preset Catalog — 2026-07-09

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Critical issue review | ✅ PASS — no open Critical Issues in `docs/ISSUES_REGISTER.md` |
| `npm run verify:native` (pre-change) | ✅ PASS |
| `npm run typecheck` (pre-change) | ✅ PASS |
| `npm test` (pre-change, 549 unit tests) | ✅ PASS |
| `npm run build` (pre-change) | ✅ PASS |
| Visible Electron manual QA (`npm run dev`) | ✅ PASS |
| `npm run typecheck` (post-change) | ✅ PASS |
| `npm test` (post-change, 555 unit tests) | ✅ PASS |

### Changes

| Area | Change |
|------|--------|
| Preset registry | Created `src/shared/connector-presets.ts` with 15 safe connector/MCP presets |
| Connectors UI | Rebuilt Settings → Connectors with search, filters, status/risk badges, configure drawer, required fields, permission explanations, and mock/live test messaging |
| Safety | Gmail requires OAuth scopes and confirmation; WhatsApp is official Business API placeholder only; Phone Companion is planned only |
| Tests | Added 6 unit tests and 1 E2E drawer/filter test |
| Repo hygiene | Added `scratch/` to `.gitignore` so diagnostic files stay local |
| Social hub | Added Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, X/Twitter, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp Business API social presets |
| Social safety | Publish, reply, delete, and upload actions require exact content preview, explicit confirmation, and cancel support |

### Manual QA Notes

- Launched the real Electron app visibly with `npm run dev`.
- Typed into the Studio composer and pressed Enter; the app navigated to Code mode and started the LivePreview local demo pipeline.
- Confirmed the LivePreview server entered Running state and rendered the local preview frame.
- Typed into the Task Brief Composer after navigation; text input was accepted.
- No account, OAuth, WhatsApp, phone, or third-party service action was performed.
- Social Connector UI is implemented as safe setup/draft/confirmation placeholders only. No social post, reply, delete, upload, scraping, or browser automation was performed.

### Remaining Limits

- Gmail, Google Drive, Google Calendar, WhatsApp Business API, Phone Companion, SMTP/IMAP, and Browser Search MCP are setup-contract placeholders, not live integrations.
- The preset drawer intentionally does not persist secrets. Live secret storage remains in Providers & Models or future encrypted connector vault flows.
- Social OAuth/API flows are setup contracts only. Future live posting/uploading must pass through exact-content confirmation and cancel.
- Full E2E, `qa:ai`, and final build are still pending for the end-of-session gate.

## Bolt-Like Prompt → Code → LivePreview Pipeline — 2026-07-09

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `npm run typecheck` | ✅ PASS |
| `npm test` (549 unit tests) | ✅ PASS |
| `npm run build` | ✅ PASS |
| Code review | ✅ PASS |

### Changes

| Area | Change |
|------|--------|
| Pipeline | New BuildPipeline service: 9 steps (classify → plan → generate → apply → preview_start → preview_ready → render → followup → complete) |
| File operations | Typed: create_file, update_file, delete_file, rename_file, mkdir with file path, language, before/after content, computed diff, status, risk |
| Code activity panel | Tabbed artifact panel: Preview / Code / Files / Diff / Plan with pipeline step timeline, file tree, line-by-line diff, cancel button |
| Deterministic demo | 3-file counter app (index.html, styles.css, app.js) with ivory/hero theme, works without any provider |
| Follow-up suggestions | 7 contextual suggestions: Improve styling, Add navigation, Add local storage, Add animations, Add dark mode, Package as PWA, Explain the code |
| Security | Path traversal blocked via startsWith check, secrets redacted via redactSecrets, IPC cancellation flag |
| Studio trigger | Composer Enter + Start building → setAutoBuildPipeline() → navigates to /code → pipeline auto-starts |
| Tests | +38 unit tests: file operations, diff, deterministic demo, follow-up suggestions, path traversal, secrets redaction |
| Docs | Created BOLT_LIKE_BUILD_PIPELINE.md (full architecture, security, testing, usage) |

### Critical Bug Fixed

- **Cascade parse error in LivePreview.tsx:** Missing closing `}` in JSX comment `{/* Diff content */}` caused `Expected "}" but found "&&"` parse error that cascaded to line 762. JSX comments must be wrapped in `{/* ... */}` — without the closing `}`, the parser consumed the next line as part of an unclosed expression. Fixed by adding the missing `}`.

### Other Fixes

- Removed `as any` cast in status update — replaced with type-safe validation against const array
- Replaced `·` middle dot with `-` in FILES tab text

### Remaining Limits

- Deterministic demo always generates counter app regardless of classified intent (MVP)
- All demo operations are `create_file` type — no update_file/delete_file/rename_file/mkdir yet
- Real provider-based generation not wired (pipeline accepts providerModelRoute but always falls back to demo)

| Dead code: handleNewTask in Sidebar | Removed |

## Coding Agent Demo — Self-Test Result

### Overview

The Coding Agent Demo proves Aureon Desk can:

1. Take a user instruction → generate a deterministic sandbox app
2. Write the app files to an isolated sandbox directory
3. Start a local preview server on a detected free port
4. Verify the rendered HTML contains all required elements
5. Report pass/fail with no secrets leaked

### Generated App: "Aureon Counter Demo"

| Requirement | Status |
| ------------ | -------- |
| Ivory background (#FAF8F5) | ✅ |
| Title "Aureon Counter Demo" | ✅ |

| Counter value display | ✅ |
| Increment button | ✅ |
| Reset button | ✅ |
| Footer "Generated by Aureon Desk" | ✅ |
| No external API calls | ✅ |
| No secrets in source | ✅ |

**Demo CLI elapsed:** ~70ms  
**Demo CLI exit code:** 0 (success)

### Sandbox Safety

- Files written under OS temp directory with random ID
- Server bound to 127.0.0.1 only (no external access)
- Sandbox deleted after verification
- No secrets, no external APIs, no network calls except localhost
- Path traversal blocked in all file operations
