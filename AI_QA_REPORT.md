## Coding Agent Demo — Self-Test Result

### Overview

The Coding Agent Demo proves Aureon Desk can:

1. Take a user instruction → generate a deterministic sandbox app
2. Write the app files to an isolated sandbox directory
3. Start a local preview server on a detected free port
4. Verify the rendered HTML contains all required elements
5. Report pass/fail with no secrets leaked

### Generated App: "Aureon Counter Demo"

| Requirement | Status |
| ------------ | -------- |
| Ivory background (#FAF8F5) | ✅ |
| Title "Aureon Counter Demo" | ✅ |
| Subtitle "Self-Test Coding Agent Demo" | ✅ |
| Counter value display | ✅ |
| Increment button | ✅ |
| Reset button | ✅ |
| Footer "Generated by Aureon Desk" | ✅ |
| No external API calls | ✅ |
| No secrets in source | ✅ |

**Demo CLI elapsed:** ~70ms  
**Demo CLI exit code:** 0 (success)

### Sandbox Safety

- Files written under OS temp directory with random ID
- Server bound to 127.0.0.1 only (no external access)
- Sandbox deleted after verification
- No secrets, no external APIs, no network calls except localhost
- Path traversal blocked in all file operations
