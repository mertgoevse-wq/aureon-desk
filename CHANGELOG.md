## [0.9.72] - 2026-07-09

### Added — Full 5 File Operation Types in Build Pipeline

**Delta Computation Engine:**
- Added `computeDeltaFileOperations` — compares new generated files against existing sandbox files to produce the correct operation type, not just `create_file`
- All 5 operation types now fully implemented end-to-end: `create_file` (new file), `update_file` (modified with before/after diff), `delete_file` (removed with destructive risk), `rename_file` (detected by content match with oldPath), `mkdir` (directory creation)
- Added `readExistingSandboxFiles` — recursively reads text files from the sandbox directory to detect existing state for delta computation
- Wired `livePreviewService.getStatus().sandboxPath` so follow-up builds automatically detect existing files and produce correct delta operations
- Added `opLabels` map — per-file generation steps now show the correct verb: Creating/Updating/Deleting/Renaming/Making directory
- Skipped (unchanged) files are excluded from generation steps, avoiding noise
- Added `fileLanguage` and `fileRisk` helpers — delete_file automatically classified as 'destructive'

**Security Hardening:**
- `applyFileOperations` now skips `status: 'skipped'` ops — no unnecessary disk writes
- Path traversal check added on `rename_file` old path — both new and old paths verified against sandbox boundary

**UI — Per-Type Visual Differentiation:**
- Added 5 new Lucide icon imports: `FilePlus`, `FilePen`, `FileMinus`, `FileSymlink`, `FolderPlus`
- CODE tab generated files list now shows distinct icons and colored labels per operation type
- FILES tab now shows colored backgrounds (emerald/amber/red/purple/blue), icons, and uppercase TYPE badges (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE/RENAME/MKDIR)
- `oldPath` display for rename operations (e.g., "src/app.tsx ← src/App.tsx")
- `skipped` status and `unchanged` label for files with no content changes

**Tests:**
- Added tests for all 5 operation types: `update_file` with before/after/diff, `delete_file` with destructive risk, `rename_file` with oldPath, `mkdir` semantics
- Updated risk classification test to verify safe vs destructive per operation type

### Verified

- `npm run typecheck` — ✅ PASS
- `npm test` — ✅ PASS (710 tests, 28 files)
- `npm run build` — ✅ PASS
- Code review — ✅ PASS (3 rounds, issues found and fixed: dead `matchedNew` variable removed, skipped ops not re-written, rename path traversal check added, `toUpperCase` error fixed)

### Remaining Limits

- No integration-style tests for `computeDeltaFileOperations` itself (only unit tests for individual operation types)
- All operations still applied to a fresh sandbox (old sandbox used for delta detection, new sandbox for apply)
- Rename detection by content match won't catch renames where content also changed

## [0.9.71] - 2026-07-09

### Added — NVIDIA NIM Support & Smart Model Routing

**NVIDIA NIM Provider:**
- Added NVIDIA NIM adapter to `PROVIDER_ADAPTERS` in `constants.ts` — free tier available via build.nvidia.com

- 3 default models: Llama 3.1 Nemotron 70B, Nemotron 4 340B, Llama 3.1 Nemotron 51B
- `nvidia` adapter case added to `chat-completion.service.ts` callProvider routing

**Token-Based Model Switching:**
- Extended `model-selector.ts` with exhaustion tracking: `markModelExhausted()`, `isModelExhausted()`, `clearModelExhaustion()`
- 5-minute auto-cooldown: exhausted models reset after cooldown period
- `selectFallbackModel()` — picks next best model when primary is exhausted
- Free tier bonus: models with `hasFreeTier: true` get +10 score boost
- All models now explicitly set `hasFreeTier: false` for type safety

**Model Router Service:**
- Created `src/main/services/model-router.service.ts` — main-process bridge between smart selector and provider DB
- `resolveBestModelForBuild()` — auto-selects best model for pipeline code generation
- `handleExhaustion()` — marks model exhausted + returns fallback
- Resolves ModelScore to DB model ID for pipeline integration

**Smart Model Selection in Studio Build Flow:**
- Studio → LivePreview pipeline now resolves the best available AI model before starting build
- `providerModelRoute` passed through sessionStorage pipeline contract
- Follow-up suggestions also use smart model resolution
- Loading state on "Start building" button while resolving model
- Model explanation shown in Studio (e.g., "Selected Llama 3.1 Nemotron 70B for Code Generation")

**Wired:**
- 6 new IPC handlers: `model-router:selectForPrompt`, `model-router:handleExhaustion`, `model-router:getExhausted`, `model-router:clearExhaustion`, `model-router:getAllScores`, `model-router:resolveBestForBuild`
- Preload bridge fully typed for model router API
- Preview helpers updated with `pipelineModelRoute` and `pipelineModelExplanation` sessionStorage keys
- LivePreview.tsx `handleFollowUp` now uses smart model selection instead of hardcoded null
- Test updated for new sessionStorage keys

- Added "Device Inputs" nav item in Settings (Camera icon)
- Wired routing, IPC registration, and preload API

**Smart Model Selection:**
- Created `src/shared/model-selector.ts` — auto-chooses best model based on context
- Supports 5 task types: code_generation, chat, vision, reasoning, fast_inference
- Scores 15+ models across OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, Mistral, Groq, OpenRouter, Ollama

## [0.9.69] - 2026-07-09

### Added — Real AI Provider Code Generation in Build Pipeline

- Wired `providerModelRoute` from `BuildRequest` to call AI providers for code generation instead of always using the deterministic demo
- Added `generateWithAI()` function: resolves provider/model via `providerService.resolveCanonicalModelReference()`, gets API key, constructs code-gen system prompt with theme colors, calls provider-specific endpoints
- Added 4 adapter-specific call functions: `callOpenAICompatibleForCode`, `callAnthropicForCode`, `callGoogleForCode`, `callOllamaForCode`
- Added `parseCodeResponse()` to extract files from AI output — tries JSON first, then markdown code block fallback
- Graceful fallback: if AI generation fails (no provider, no API key, network error, bad response), pipeline automatically falls back to the deterministic local demo
- Extracted `THEME_COLORS` to module-level constant shared by both demo and AI code generation paths
- Fixed `isDemo` to dynamically update when falling back from AI to demo (was `const`, now `let`)

## [0.9.64] - 2026-07-09

### Added — Bolt-Like Prompt → Code → LivePreview Pipeline

**Canonical Build Pipeline:**

- New `BuildPipeline` service with 9 steps: classify intent → create plan → generate file operations → show pending changes → apply to sandbox → start preview → stream status → show rendered preview → generate follow-up suggestions
- Typed file operations: `create_file`, `update_file`, `delete_file`, `rename_file`, `mkdir` — each with file path, language, before/after content, computed diff, status, and risk level
- `BuildRequest` and `BuildResult` types with mode: `plan-only` | `generate` | `generate-and-preview`
- `BuildPipelineStatus` streamed to renderer via IPC events for real-time step updates

**Code Activity Panel (LivePreview):**

- Tabbed artifact panel: **Preview** / **Code** / **Files** / **Diff** / **Plan**
- Code tab: pipeline step timeline with spinner/check/error icons, current file being edited, file path in grey, message details
- Files tab: file tree with path, language, type, "View diff" action
- Diff tab: file selector pills + line-by-line diff with green (add) / red (remove) / grey (context) coloring
- Plan tab: prompt + build plan steps
- Auto-switches to Preview tab after first successful render
- "Local Demo" badge when no remote provider is available
- Cancel/Stop button to abort running build
- Follow-up suggestions after render: Improve styling, Add navigation, Add local storage, Add animations, Add dark mode, Package as PWA, Explain the code

**Deterministic Local Demo:**

- When no AI provider is available, pipeline generates a working 3-file counter app (index.html, styles.css, app.js) with ivory/hero theme
- Counter with increment/reset, visible heading, responsive layout
- Clearly labeled "Local Demo" so users know it's not from a remote provider
- Works without any API keys for testing and demo purposes

**Security:**

- Path traversal blocked via `resolved.startsWith(path.resolve(sandboxPath))` check
- Secrets redacted via `redactSecrets()` before writing any file to disk
- IPC cancellation flag prevents partial writes

**Files Created:**

- `src/shared/types/build-pipeline.ts` — typed pipeline contract
- `src/main/services/build-pipeline.service.ts` — core engine
- `src/main/ipc/build-pipeline.ipc.ts` — IPC handlers
- `tests/unit/build-pipeline.test.ts` — 38 unit tests
- `docs/BOLT_LIKE_BUILD_PIPELINE.md` — full pipeline documentation

**Files Modified:**

- `src/main/ipc/index.ts` — registered `registerBuildPipelineIPC`
- `src/preload/index.ts` + `index.d.ts` — exposed `buildRun`, `buildCancel`, `onBuildStep`, `onBuildComplete`
- `src/shared/preview-helpers.ts` — added `setAutoBuildPipeline()` / `getAndClearBuildPipeline()` helpers
- `src/renderer/src/pages/Studio.tsx` — wired composer Enter + Start building to new pipeline
- `src/renderer/src/pages/LivePreview.tsx` — added tabbed artifact panel, pipeline step streaming, file tree, diff view, follow-up suggestions

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL: Cascade parse error in LivePreview.tsx** — missing closing `}` in JSX comment `{/* Diff content */}` caused `Expected "}" but found "&&"` parse error that cascaded to line 762. Fixed by adding the missing `}`.
- **TypeScript `as any` removed** — replaced `s.previewStatus as any || prev.status` with type-safe validation against a `const` array of valid statuses. Honors the AGENTS.md "Don't type cast as `any` type" rule.
- **Non-ASCII character in JSX text** — replaced `·` (middle dot) with `-` in FILES tab file type display to prevent parser edge cases on different platforms.

### Tests Added (38 new)

- `tests/unit/build-pipeline.test.ts`:
  - Build request creates file operations (create_file, update_file)
  - File diff generated (add/remove/context lines)
  - Deterministic demo renders (index.html, styles.css, app.js)
  - Follow-up suggestions generated (7 categories)
  - Path traversal blocked (relative `../` escape attempts)
  - Secrets ignored (API keys redacted before write)
  - Intent classification (build_app, build_component, etc.)
  - Cancel/abort functionality
  - Plan generation from prompt keywords

### Verified

- `npm run typecheck` — ✅ PASS
- `npm test` — ✅ PASS (549 tests, 23 files)
- `npm run build` — ✅ PASS
- Code review — ✅ PASS

### Remaining Limits

- Deterministic demo always generates a counter app regardless of classified intent (MVP only)
- All file operations are `create_file` type for the deterministic demo — no `update_file`/`delete_file`/`rename_file`/`mkdir` operations generated yet
- Real provider-based generation not yet wired (pipeline accepts `providerModelRoute` but always falls back to deterministic demo)
- No real-time diff streaming for `update_file` operations
- No screenshot capture for manual QA docs yet (pending headless dev environment)

## [0.9.62] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed — Product Stability Audit Bug Fixes

**LivePreview Error Retry Style Loss:**

- Fixed bug where error retry in LivePreview always fell back to "Calming Ivory" theme regardless of user's selected style. Root cause: `clearAutoPreview()` was called on mount, wiping sessionStorage before the retry handler could read the style.
- Now saves the auto-preview style in a `useRef` before clearing sessionStorage, so the retry handler can access the correct theme.
- Replaced hardcoded `'build-app-style'` string with `AUTO_PREVIEW_KEYS.style` constant to maintain the shared helper contract.

**README Banner Path:**

- Fixed broken GitHub banner image path from non-existent `assets/brand/nano-banana/aureon-github-banner.png` to correct `assets/brand/aureon-github-banner-1200.png`.

### Created

- `docs/CURRENT_PRODUCT_GAP_AUDIT.md` — comprehensive 15-section product gap audit covering hero landing, theme, LivePreview, Studio, Vibe Coding, buttons/dropdowns, providers, MCP/connectors, brand assets, onboarding, skills/agents, search, performance, cleanup, and next implementation order
