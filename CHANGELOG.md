## [0.9.82] - 2026-07-10 — LivePreview Reliability Pass

### Fixed
- **Port Detection Race Condition:** Replaced the synchronous `execSync` child-process port probe loop in `live-preview.service.ts` with an in-process `net.createServer()` async socket binding check. Eliminates Windows quoting failures and process-spawn overhead, making port resolution fast and reliable.
- **Blank Preview Frame on Starting State:** `LivePreview.tsx` now renders the preview `<iframe>` during both `'starting'` and `'running'` states. A backdrop-blur loading spinner overlay is shown while the server is initialising so the frame never appears blank.
- **Iframe Cache Stale Renders:** Added a `key={status.id}` prop to the preview iframe so React fully remounts it on each new session, preventing stale cached page loads.
- **URL Input Not Reflecting Live URL:** The hidden `[data-testid="preview-url-input"]` value now binds to `status.url || customUrl` so Playwright E2E tests can reliably read the server URL after the session starts.
- **Race Condition Status Demotion:** Added a guard in the `onBuildStep` status updater: if the preview is already `'running'` or `'error'`, subsequent pipeline events cannot demote it back to `'starting'` or `'idle'`.
- **IPC Type Mismatch:** Updated `live-preview.ipc.ts` `preview:createDemo` handler to `async` returning `Promise<CodingDemoResult>` to match the now-async service method.

### Added
- **Diagnostics Panel:** New inline panel below the server controls bar in `LivePreview.tsx` showing the live preview URL (clickable), current status, last error, a "Restart Preview" button, and a "Copy Diagnostics" clipboard button. All elements are tagged with `data-testid` for E2E testing.
- **Full Interactive Lifecycle E2E Test:** Added `test('LivePreview full interactive lifecycle — start, stop, restart, and diagnostics')` in `tests/e2e/09-vibeforge-live-preview.spec.ts` covering: template selection, server start, URL non-blank assertion, diagnostics elements, stop, and restart.
- **Async Unit Tests:** Updated all `tests/unit/live-preview.test.ts` test cases that call `startPreview`, `startGeneratedPreview`, or `createDemo` to use `async/await` consistently with the refactored service API.

### Changed
- `livePreviewService.startPreview()`, `startGeneratedPreview()`, and `createDemo()` are now `async` methods returning `Promise<…>`.
- `build-pipeline.service.ts` awaits `livePreviewService.startPreview()` at the build completion step.

## [0.9.81] - 2026-07-10 — Vibeforge Codex-like Simplification Pass


### Added
- **Beginner Guidance Banners:** Added prominent info banners on empty home views and sidebars for Studio (`Studio.tsx`), Chat (`ChatWorkspace.tsx`), and LivePreview (`LivePreview.tsx`) to explain page purpose, next steps, and template execution.
- **ESC Key Handlers:** Integrated Escape key event listeners on model selectors, chat dropdowns (system prompt, projects), and preview controls to dismiss open drawers and overlays instantly.

### Changed
- **Main Sidebar Layout:** Regrouped navigation to vertical Primary, Secondary, and Advanced list, hiding Advanced options behind a toggle that synchronizes to local storage (`vb_show_advanced_nav`).
- **Settings Categories Layout:** Grouped settings into Core and Advanced menus, collapsing Advanced categories under an expandable toggle header synced with local storage (`vb_show_advanced_settings`).
- **Tab Synchronization:** Configured `LearnPage.tsx` to read the `tab` URL query parameters on mount and keep internal active tab state in sync via `useSearchParams`.
- **Button Consolidation:** Renamed primary building actions in the composer and task drawers to a single consistent **"Build with Preview"** CTA. Clicking "Build with Preview" with the "Coding Demo" template selected now launches the coding demo directly without requiring prompt inputs.

## [0.9.80] - 2026-07-10 — Rebrand Vibeforge Pass

### Rebranded
- **Product Name:** Changed from "Aureon Desk" to "Vibeforge" globally across the app code, E2E tests, build paths, and scripts.
- **Migration & App Data Safety:** Implemented dynamic `%APPDATA%\aureon-desk` path fallback override in the Electron entrypoint to prevent user configurations or API keys from resetting.
- **Brand Assets:** Compiled updated Vibeforge brand SVG vector marks to individual sizes (32, 64, 128, 256) and generated the main `icon.ico` and `icon.png` application icons. Added legacy Aureon duplicates to public assets to prevent broken file paths.
- **Playwright E2E Specs:** Renamed E2E test files under `tests/e2e/` from `*-aureon-*` to `*-vibeforge-*` and updated package script pathways.
- **Diagnostics:** verify:native (pass), typecheck (pass), npm test (pass), npm run build (pass).

## [0.9.79] - 2026-07-10 — Handoff Verification & Diagnostics

### Checked
- **App Health:** Baseline validation run complete with 0 critical issues.
- **Node Environment:** Documented compatibility details for Node v20.19.5 vs system-default Node v26.4.0.

## [0.9.76] - 2026-07-10

### Added — Artifact & Output Renderer System

**Artifact Types (16):**
- Created `src/shared/artifacts.ts` — typed artifact system with prompt, code, text, markdown, file-tree, diff, preview, build-plan, search-results, image-gallery, tutorial, checklist, command, error-diagnostic, provider-setup, skill-result
- Each artifact: id, type, title, subtitle, content, actions, createdAt, risk level
- Factory helpers: `codeArtifactFromFileOp`, `promptArtifactFromTemplate`, `diffArtifactFromDiff`, `buildPlanArtifact`, `createArtifactId`
- Content parser: `parseArtifactsFromContent()` — extracts fenced code blocks from markdown, supports filename hints (`# src/file.ts`), CRLF + LF line endings, whitespace normalization

**Artifact Renderer Components (14 files):**
- Created `src/renderer/src/components/artifacts/` with 14 component files + barrel export
- `ArtifactCard` — universal router mapping type → view with copy/collapse actions

- Each supports copy, expand/collapse, send-to-composer (where applicable)

**Chat Integration:**
- `MessageBubble.tsx` now parses AI assistant messages for code blocks and renders `ArtifactCard` components below the markdown content
- Cleaned markdown (code blocks removed) still renders first; artifacts appear below

**LivePreview Integration:**
- Added 6th "Cards" tab in build pipeline panel — renders build plan, code files, and diffs as ArtifactCards

- `npm run build` — ✅ PASS

## [0.9.74] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed — Brand Logo Visibility & Asset System Finalization

**Root cause:** CSS variables (`var(--ivory-accent)`) in SVG presentation attributes were failing to resolve in some Electron/Chromium rendering paths, causing the Aureon mark to render invisible.

**Fix:** Replaced all CSS variable references in AureonMark.tsx with hardcoded brand hex colors (#B8683A, #A45A30, #F9EFE9, #E8A45C). Increased ring stroke opacity (0.25→0.30) and neural node dot sizes for guaranteed visibility on ivory backgrounds. Added `useId()` for collision-free gradient IDs.

**Brand wiring complete:**
- Branding visible in: sidebar (expanded + collapsed), topbar, Settings layout, Studio hero
- Added `BrandLockupCompact` convenience component for icon-only rendering
- Created new `assets/brand/aureon-logo-lockup.svg` and `assets/brand/aureon-github-banner.svg`
- Created `scripts/generate-brand-assets.mjs` — reproducible asset generation using canvas package
- Regenerated `build/icon.ico` as PNG-based multi-size ICO (7 sizes: 16,24,32,48,64,128,256)
- Regenerated all `public/brand/*.png` and `build/icon*.png` assets

### Verified

- `npm run typecheck` — ✅ PASS (tsconfig.node.json + tsconfig.web.json)
- `npm test` — ✅ PASS (768 tests, 30 files)
- `npm run build` — ✅ PASS (electron-vite)
- Brand asset generation — ✅ PASS (20 files generated)

## [0.9.73] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed — MCP Connection and Confirmation Safety

- MCP server connections now pass the same enabled/trusted/destructive-permission gate as tool execution before a stdio process or network transport is opened.
- Untrusted and disabled MCP servers are blocked before connection; destructive but trusted servers now present a separate connection confirmation.
- Confirmed MCP tool calls now carry an explicit confirmation flag through renderer, preload, IPC, and main process, so approval no longer loops back to another “Confirmation required” response.
- Restricted SSE/HTTP MCP endpoints to HTTP(S) URLs and redacted MCP stderr before it reaches application logs.
- Added six regression tests covering connection blocking, confirmation forwarding, URL validation, and stderr redaction.

### Verified

- `npm run verify:native` — PASS
- `npm run typecheck` — PASS
- `npm test` — PASS (768 tests, 30 files)
- `npm run build` — PASS

### Remaining Limits

- A third-party MCP server was not connected during this change; the real-server flow still needs a user-configured server and a visible desktop check.

## [0.9.72] - 2026-07-09

### Added — Full 5 File Operation Types in Build Pipeline

**Delta Computation Engine:**
- Added `computeDeltaFileOperations` — compares new generated files against existing sandbox files to produce the correct operation type, not just `create_file`
- All 5 operation types now fully implemented end-to-end: `create_file` (new file), `update_file` (modified with before/after diff), `delete_file` (removed with destructive risk), `rename_file` (detected by content match with oldPath), `mkdir` (directory creation)
- Added `readExistingSandboxFiles` — recursively reads text files from the sandbox directory to detect existing state for delta computation
- Wired `livePreviewService.getStatus().sandboxPath` so follow-up builds automatically detect existing files and produce correct delta operations
- Added `opLabels` map — per-file generation steps now show the correct verb: Creating/Updating/Deleting/Renaming/Making directory
- Skipped (unchanged) files are excluded from generation steps, avoiding noise
- Added `fileLanguage` and `fileRisk` helpers — delete_file automatically classified as 'destructive'

**Security Hardening:**
- `applyFileOperations` now skips `status: 'skipped'` ops — no unnecessary disk writes
- Path traversal check added on `rename_file` old path — both new and old paths verified against sandbox boundary

**UI — Per-Type Visual Differentiation:**
- Added 5 new Lucide icon imports: `FilePlus`, `FilePen`, `FileMinus`, `FileSymlink`, `FolderPlus`
- CODE tab generated files list now shows distinct icons and colored labels per operation type
- FILES tab now shows colored backgrounds (emerald/amber/red/purple/blue), icons, and uppercase TYPE badges (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE/RENAME/MKDIR)
- `oldPath` display for rename operations (e.g., "src/app.tsx ← src/App.tsx")
- `skipped` status and `unchanged` label for files with no content changes

**Tests:**
- Added tests for all 5 operation types: `update_file` with before/after/diff, `delete_file` with destructive risk, `rename_file` with oldPath, `mkdir` semantics
- Updated risk classification test to verify safe vs destructive per operation type

### Verified

- `npm run typecheck` — ✅ PASS
- `npm test` — ✅ PASS (710 tests, 28 files)
- `npm run build` — ✅ PASS
- Code review — ✅ PASS (3 rounds, issues found and fixed: dead `matchedNew` variable removed, skipped ops not re-written, rename path traversal check added, `toUpperCase` error fixed)

### Remaining Limits

- No integration-style tests for `computeDeltaFileOperations` itself (only unit tests for individual operation types)
- All operations still applied to a fresh sandbox (old sandbox used for delta detection, new sandbox for apply)
- Rename detection by content match won't catch renames where content also changed

---

## [0.9.71] - 2026-07-09

- `selectFallbackModel()` — picks next best model when primary is exhausted
- Free tier bonus: models with `hasFreeTier: true` get +10 score boost
- All models now explicitly set `hasFreeTier: false` for type safety

**Model Router Service:**
- Created `src/main/services/model-router.service.ts` — main-process bridge between smart selector and provider DB
- `resolveBestModelForBuild()` — auto-selects best model for pipeline code generation
- `handleExhaustion()` — marks model exhausted + returns fallback
- Resolves ModelScore to DB model ID for pipeline integration

**Smart Model Selection in Studio Build Flow:**
- Studio → LivePreview pipeline now resolves the best available AI model before starting build
- `providerModelRoute` passed through sessionStorage pipeline contract
- Follow-up suggestions also use smart model resolution
- Loading state on "Start building" button while resolving model
- Model explanation shown in Studio (e.g., "Selected Llama 3.1 Nemotron 70B for Code Generation")

**Wired:**
- 6 new IPC handlers: `model-router:selectForPrompt`, `model-router:handleExhaustion`, `model-router:getExhausted`, `model-router:clearExhaustion`, `model-router:getAllScores`, `model-router:resolveBestForBuild`
- Preload bridge fully typed for model router API
- Preview helpers updated with `pipelineModelRoute` and `pipelineModelExplanation` sessionStorage keys

## [0.9.69] - 2026-07-09

### Added — Real AI Provider Code Generation in Build Pipeline

- Wired `providerModelRoute` from `BuildRequest` to call AI providers for code generation instead of always using the deterministic demo
- Added `generateWithAI()` function: resolves provider/model via `providerService.resolveCanonicalModelReference()`, gets API key, constructs code-gen system prompt with theme colors, calls provider-specific endpoints
- Added 4 adapter-specific call functions: `callOpenAICompatibleForCode`, `callAnthropicForCode`, `callGoogleForCode`, `callOllamaForCode`
- Added `parseCodeResponse()` to extract files from AI output — tries JSON first, then markdown code block fallback
- Graceful fallback: if AI generation fails (no provider, no API key, network error, bad response), pipeline automatically falls back to the deterministic local demo
- Extracted `THEME_COLORS` to module-level constant shared by both demo and AI code generation paths
- Fixed `isDemo` to dynamically update when falling back from AI to demo (was `const`, now `let`)

## [0.9.65] - 2026-07-09

### Added — Safe Connector & MCP Preset Catalog

- Added `src/shared/connector-presets.ts` as the canonical safe preset catalog for 15 services:
  OpenAI API, Google Gemini API, OpenRouter, Anthropic, Gmail OAuth, Google Drive OAuth, Google Calendar OAuth, GitHub, MCP Server Custom, Local Ollama, LM Studio, Phone Companion, WhatsApp Business API, Email SMTP/IMAP, and Browser Search MCP.
- Rebuilt Settings → Connectors around the preset catalog with search, status filters, neutral Lucide icons, risk/status badges, setup guidance, permission explanations, required-field preview, connection-test messaging, and a right-side configuration drawer.
- Marked Gmail OAuth as planned with explicit OAuth scopes and user-approval requirements.
- Marked WhatsApp as an official WhatsApp Business API placeholder only; no WhatsApp Web, phone-screen, or personal-account automation.
- Marked Phone Companion as planned until a companion app, local pairing, and explicit device permissions exist.
- Added `.gitignore` coverage for `scratch/` so local diagnostic files do not enter commits.
- Added `src/shared/social-connectors.ts` with safe social connector presets for Facebook Graph API, Instagram Graph API, YouTube Data API, YouTube Upload, TikTok, X/Twitter, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp Business API.
- Added a Social Connectors section to Settings → Connectors with neutral icons, scopes, "what this can do", "what this cannot do", test placeholders, draft action previews, and a confirmation modal contract.
- Added explicit social action contracts for comment summaries, draft posts/replies, analytics placeholders, video descriptions, hashtags, upload checklists, scheduled drafts, and confirmation-only publish/reply/delete/upload actions.

### Tests Added

- Added `tests/unit/connector-presets.test.ts` for preset validation, Gmail scopes, WhatsApp API-only guardrails, Phone Companion planned status, and neutral icon contracts.
- Added `tests/unit/social-connectors.test.ts` for social registry validation, YouTube/Meta scopes, confirmation-only destructive actions, and WhatsApp Business API constraints.
- Added an E2E drawer/filter check to `tests/e2e/18-aureon-studio-vibe-flow.spec.ts`.
- Added an E2E Social Connectors drawer/confirmation flow to `tests/e2e/18-aureon-studio-vibe-flow.spec.ts`.

## [0.9.64] - 2026-07-09

### Added — Bolt-Like Prompt → Code → LivePreview Pipeline

**Canonical Build Pipeline:**

- New `BuildPipeline` service with 9 steps: classify intent → create plan → generate file operations → show pending changes → apply to sandbox → start preview → stream status → show rendered preview → generate follow-up suggestions
- Typed file operations: `create_file`, `update_file`, `delete_file`, `rename_file`, `mkdir` — each with file path, language, before/after content, computed diff, status, and risk level
- `BuildRequest` and `BuildResult` types with mode: `plan-only` | `generate` | `generate-and-preview`
- `BuildPipelineStatus` streamed to renderer via IPC events for real-time step updates

**Code Activity Panel (LivePreview):**

- Tabbed artifact panel: **Preview** / **Code** / **Files** / **Diff** / **Plan**
- Code tab: pipeline step timeline with spinner/check/error icons, current file being edited, file path in grey, message details
- Files tab: file tree with path, language, type, "View diff" action
- Diff tab: file selector pills + line-by-line diff with green (add) / red (remove) / grey (context) coloring
- Plan tab: prompt + build plan steps
- Auto-switches to Preview tab after first successful render
- "Local Demo" badge when no remote provider is available
- Cancel/Stop button to abort running build
- Follow-up suggestions after render: Improve styling, Add navigation, Add local storage, Add animations, Add dark mode, Package as PWA, Explain the code

**Deterministic Local Demo:**

- When no AI provider is available, pipeline generates a working 3-file counter app (index.html, styles.css, app.js) with ivory/hero theme
- Counter with increment/reset, visible heading, responsive layout
- Clearly labeled "Local Demo" so users know it's not from a remote provider
- Works without any API keys for testing and demo purposes

**Security:**

- Path traversal blocked via `resolved.startsWith(path.resolve(sandboxPath))` check
- Secrets redacted via `redactSecrets()` before writing any file to disk
- IPC cancellation flag prevents partial writes

**Files Created:**

- `src/shared/types/build-pipeline.ts` — typed pipeline contract
- `src/main/services/build-pipeline.service.ts` — core engine
- `src/main/ipc/build-pipeline.ipc.ts` — IPC handlers
- `tests/unit/build-pipeline.test.ts` — 38 unit tests
- `docs/BOLT_LIKE_BUILD_PIPELINE.md` — full pipeline documentation

**Files Modified:**

- `src/main/ipc/index.ts` — registered `registerBuildPipelineIPC`
- `src/preload/index.ts` + `index.d.ts` — exposed `buildRun`, `buildCancel`, `onBuildStep`, `onBuildComplete`
- `src/shared/preview-helpers.ts` — added `setAutoBuildPipeline()` / `getAndClearBuildPipeline()` helpers
- `src/renderer/src/pages/Studio.tsx` — wired composer Enter + Start building to new pipeline
- `src/renderer/src/pages/LivePreview.tsx` — added tabbed artifact panel, pipeline step streaming, file tree, diff view, follow-up suggestions

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL: Cascade parse error in LivePreview.tsx** — missing closing `}` in JSX comment `{/* Diff content */}` caused `Expected "}" but found "&&"` parse error that cascaded to line 762. Fixed by adding the missing `}`.
- **TypeScript `as any` removed** — replaced `s.previewStatus as any || prev.status` with type-safe validation against a `const` array of valid statuses. Honors the AGENTS.md "Don't type cast as `any` type" rule.
- **Non-ASCII character in JSX text** — replaced `·` (middle dot) with `-` in FILES tab file type display to prevent parser edge cases on different platforms.

### Tests Added (38 new)

- `tests/unit/build-pipeline.test.ts`:
  - Build request creates file operations (create_file, update_file)
  - File diff generated (add/remove/context lines)
  - Deterministic demo renders (index.html, styles.css, app.js)
  - Follow-up suggestions generated (7 categories)
  - Path traversal blocked (relative `../` escape attempts)
  - Secrets ignored (API keys redacted before write)
  - Intent classification (build_app, build_component, etc.)
  - Cancel/abort functionality
  - Plan generation from prompt keywords

### Verified

- `npm run typecheck` — ✅ PASS
- `npm test` — ✅ PASS (549 tests, 23 files)
- `npm run build` — ✅ PASS
- Code review — ✅ PASS

### Remaining Limits

- Deterministic demo always generates a counter app regardless of classified intent (MVP only)
- All file operations are `create_file` type for the deterministic demo — no `update_file`/`delete_file`/`rename_file`/`mkdir` operations generated yet
- Real provider-based generation not yet wired (pipeline accepts `providerModelRoute` but always falls back to deterministic demo)
- No real-time diff streaming for `update_file` operations
- No screenshot capture for manual QA docs yet (pending headless dev environment)

## [0.9.62] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed — Product Stability Audit Bug Fixes

**LivePreview Error Retry Style Loss:**

- Fixed bug where error retry in LivePreview always fell back to "Calming Ivory" theme regardless of user's selected style. Root cause: `clearAutoPreview()` was called on mount, wiping sessionStorage before the retry handler could read the style.
- Now saves the auto-preview style in a `useRef` before clearing sessionStorage, so the retry handler can access the correct theme.
- Replaced hardcoded `'build-app-style'` string with `AUTO_PREVIEW_KEYS.style` constant to maintain the shared helper contract.

**README Banner Path:**

- Fixed broken GitHub banner image path from non-existent `assets/brand/nano-banana/aureon-github-banner.png` to correct `assets/brand/aureon-github-banner-1200.png`.

### Created

- `docs/CURRENT_PRODUCT_GAP_AUDIT.md` — comprehensive 15-section product gap audit covering hero landing, theme, LivePreview, Studio, Vibe Coding, buttons/dropdowns, providers, MCP/connectors, brand assets, onboarding, skills/agents, search, performance, cleanup, and next implementation order

# Changelog

All notable changes to Aureon Desk are documented here.

## [Unreleased] — Visible Human QA Harness (2026-07-09)

### Added

- **`tests/e2e/aureon-human-visible.spec.ts`** — 20-step Playwright Electron
  headed harness that launches the real Aureon Desk app visibly, exercises
  the full Studio → Code → LivePreview → Provider → MCP pipeline, and
  saves numbered PNG screenshots to `tests/e2e/artifacts/human-visible/`.
- **`npm run test:human:headed`** — headed mode, `workers=1`, full screenshot pipeline.
- **`npm run test:human:headed:slow`** — bash-friendly slow-motion variant
  (uses `AUREON_SLOW_MO_MS=500`).
- **`npm run test:human:ui`** — Playwright UI mode for manual step-by-step review.
- **`docs/HUMAN_VISIBLE_QA_HARNESS.md`** — operator-facing runbook + screenshot map.

### Changed

- **`tests/e2e/helpers/electronApp.ts`** — added optional
  `AUREON_SLOW_MO_MS` env var piped into `electron.launch({ slowMo })`.
  Slow-motion is opt-in; global E2E tests run fast when the env var is unset.
- **Step 17 (MCP safety gate) assertion is now source-accurate** —
  matches the actual `ToolsPage.tsx` modal copy: "disabled by default" +
  "review capabilities before enabling".

### Notes

- Console errors are logged but non-fatal, matching the existing
  `tests/e2e/99-human-click-qa.spec.ts` convention. The harness fails
  only on `pageerror` (React crashes) — which is the standard for human
  review runs.
